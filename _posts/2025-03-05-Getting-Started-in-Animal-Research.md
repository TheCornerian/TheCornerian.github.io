Career path is not determined by aptitude tests but rather by where we put our time in. You may have taken one as I did in high school, designed to inform and guide you to a career utilizing your strengths... and ideally, your interests.
When mine read engineer, I'm embarrassed to say I was confused. I had no idea what an engineer does. I had spent the majority of my life convinced that I wanted to be a physician. I wanted to help people, as
we all do pursuing the profession, and I believed my proclivity to math and science would actualize into an admission to medical school. There were only a couple issues, at first, that stood in my way.
Tomo and germophobia. The sight of gore could immediately invoke sweating, anxiety, and fear. And I could hardly stand to be around anyone that was sick. You might expect that to be a definitive deal breaker for medical school, but
my applications never got that far! (ha) In the meantime I was volunteering for a Alzheimer's disease research lab conducting research on rodents, where my fears played out as living nightmares, and my own personal circle of hell. Surely I could never become good at this, I could hardly stand in the room some days.
I should have questioned more then why I decided to show up <ev>there<ev/> everyday, and not anywhere else. I had a job to pay my bills through undergrad, and I gave up precious work hours to be in the lab instead. So why did I do it?

The science of course!

I loved studying the brain and I loved biology. So much that I stayed on as a technician for several years post graduation, and before joining the graduate program. I encountered many students mostly unfazed by the physically and emotionally exhausting ordeal that I believed it to be.
Meanwhile I struggled through every single new protocol and manipulation I needed to learn. But, over time my feelings of fear were replaced with feelings of accomplishment, that I had conquered my fear and did the job. In fact, I could not only do the job but do it <ev>well<ev/>. Euthanasias, surgeries, all forms of injections, dissections, and more.

And finally, after facing fear over and over again, I found myself ready to rid myself of my fear once and for all, by one last protocol. It was the one I couldn't even watch when I started. And here I was, 9 YEARS LATER at the table!... And courage finally prevailed.

Now this is not a means to push you, the reader, into pursuing a career in animal research. There are many areas of medical research that contribute substantively to their respective fields and do not involve any animal work. But if you are someone who wants to participate in a lab's animal research, but for reasons such as fear and self doubt are apprehensive about joining a lab that conducts animal research, I wanted to share my story, and below a few thoughts I had over the years including advice I received that helped me. I hope they may help you too.

1. For research, animal rights are protected, and humane treatment is enforced: This was a big one for me, hence why I listed it at the top. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) exist to regulate animal research to ensure the ethical and humane treatment of animals for research. All protocols conducted in a lab that involves animals must be reviewed by this committee and approved prior to any procedures being done. Part of their work involves refining protocols to improve animal welfare, and may reduce the number of animals needed to complete a study. In short, there are standards for animal treatment and care in research that are strictly followed, and clear boundaries that won't be crossed.

2. The science you conduct, and the knowledge you will receive is worth facing your fear: This may seem obvious, but your PI's research was funded for a reason! Grants are awarded by percentile rank, meaning only the highest scoring grants are awarded. 
So you should be convinced that the questions you will answer <ev>matter<ev/>. Furthermore, the passing of knowledge and technical skills onto you is critical to accomplishing the long term goals of funding agencies. It is crucial that you really believe that and
have a real passion for the science.  If you are still reading this, you can be sure this is the case!

3. It's not as bad as it used to be: Before the refinement of protocols, molecular technology, computational biology, and AI medical science required much more labor from scientists, and animal research was essential to answer even the most basic questions.
This partially ties into point number one, scientific progress has effectively reduced or reserved the use of animals for experiments that have at least partially tested theories.

4. Take care of your mental health: While getting acquianted especially, animal work can be emotionally draining. Be sure to do things for yourself such as exercise, spend time with friends and family, and get enough rest. Most importantly, be sure to seek help if you need it from campus resources and/or using the 988 crisis hotline. I'll reiterate that animal research is not for everyone, and it's okay to step away from it to pursue other areas of research! It's up to you to decide your boundaries.

5. It gets easier over time: And becoming desensitized will not make you a bad person. Scientists have a deep appreciation for the animals in their research and it is not uncommon to be fond of them. Having your fear released will make you more attentive, result in better animal treatment, and better science.

6. The job market is in high demand for animal researchers: They are continuously in high demand at universities and in industry and that is not likely to change, since institutional review boards require therapeutics to be rigorously tested in animals prior to clinical trials. This leads me to my next point.

7. This one is strange to say out loud but I have found it to be the truth: The work will go on with or without you. For the fearful that might seem just alright with you, at first. But there is another fear that many more of us face in science, the fear of missing out (FOMO). As with any degree program there are experiences that are core to the student experience. You may experience it first during rotations, but will
certainly face it as a professional, competition. During rotations you will encounter well respected and funded labs that align well with your research interests, but use techniques that lie far outside of your comfort zone. That is okay. If you want to learn, be proactive in speaking with the PI and see if you can get involved while you are in rotation. This brings me to my last point.

8. Find a mentor and lab group that is supportive, patient, and kind: This is important. Facing your fears and lack of experience is going to frequently put you in vulnerable and potentially embarrassing situations. Being in a nurturing learning environment is going to be key for you to be willing to put yourself in the hot seat over and over again. Communicate with your PI and senior lab members, make goals, and allow yourself to be held accountable to them. You will face failures during your graduate school journey. That is why resilience is often stated as the most important quality in successful graduate students. 

If you've read up to this far, thank you! I hope you will take away something that helps you in your journey, or just found it an interesting enough read! We all come into graduate school from different places, and it's okay to be unsure of your boundaries as you begin to navigate a career in medical research. Take it slow, take care of yourself, and don't be afraid of facing failure or your fears.
