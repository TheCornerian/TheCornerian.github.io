Hi! Thank you for visiting my site. My name is Blaine Weiss. I am currently a graduate student at the University of Kentucky working in the Sanders Brown Center on Aging. My research interests involve utilizing brain electrophysiology, intravital fluorescence imaging, and custom analytical techniques to investigate physiological characteristics of neurological diseases and therapeutic efficacy. My specialty is in two-photon microscopy using awake mice, and the main focus of my research is to characterize astrocyte reactivity with Alzheimer's disease and vascular contributions in dementia (VCID) In Dr. Norris's lab, we combine cutting edge molecular tools such as cell specific viral constructs and animal models with advanced imaging technology to observe and intervene with disease processes.

I created this site to share my portfolio of fluorescence microscopy analysis tools, publication history, and my insights into brain physiology gathered during imaging experiments, and during data analysis. Here I'll discuss approaches, protocols, and review of literature in blog format. Feel free to follow me on socials, which you can find at the bottom of the page.
