Hello world! My name is Kevin Largent. You might be thinking, “Okay… cool… but what does that mean for me?”
Fair question.

This little corner of the internet exists to answer exactly that, ideally in a way that’s fun, slightly chaotic (the good kind), and maybe even a bit inspiring.

So let’s start at the top. I’ll give you the high-level version of who I am, what gets me fired up, and why I spend my days bouncing between power electronics, software, music, and whatever else I can get my hands on.

### My Story

At the heart of everything I do, I really just try to be a good person. Sounds simple, but honestly? That’s the foundation. I want people to feel encouraged around me. Like they can take on something new, push their limits a little, and maybe surprise themselves. If someone walks away thinking, “Huh… maybe I can learn this,” that’s a win in my book.

And speaking of learning, that’s kind of my whole thing. I’m constantly bouncing between new engineering skills: analog design one week, PostgreSQL the next, embedded systems, power electronics, software tools, etc. If it sparks curiosity, I’m diving in. I love that messy, exciting space where you’re learning as you go and everything finally clicks.

But above all, I want people to know I’m a pretty relaxed guy. Filled with anxiety, but personality wise, pretty relaxed! No "im better than you" ego, no weirdness (except my fascination with space... and ALIENS!) just someone who enjoys the process, tries to keep things positive, and wants to build cool things with cool people.

I’ve had a pretty winding path, and honestly, that’s part of what makes me… me. I went to graduate school and dove deep into power electronics; the kind of stuff where you’re modeling converters, chasing down high-frequency phenomena in DC-DC converters or motor drives, and occasionally wondering why you ever thought this was a good idea. I didn’t end up finishing the PhD, but the experience changed me over the course of those three two and a half years. I learned a ton, pushed myself hard, and realized something important: I genuinely love figuring things out.

Whether it’s engineering, making music, or even a random detail in a video game, my curiosity is kind of chaotic in the best way. I’m a little sporadic and I’ll admit that. If something catches my attention, I have to understand it. And my learning style? All hands-on. I like jumping into things before I fully get them, messing around, breaking stuff, fixing it again, and sticking with it until the whole picture finally clicks.

It’s not the neatest process, but it’s always real, and it’s how I grow.

If you asked my friends to describe me, you’d probably hear some mix of funny, crazy, and different. Honestly, I’ll take it. I like bringing good energy into whatever I’m doing. I joke around, I get excited about weird things, and I don’t really fit into the “standard template” of anything. But that’s the part I love. Being a little different is what makes life and learning, well, actually interesting.

Whether I’m diving into some new engineering rabbit hole or messing around with music, I try to keep things light, fun, and a little unpredictable. I’m the type of person who’ll make you laugh, pull you into some random project, and encourage you the whole way through.

I like living in that space where engineering and personality overlap. Somwhere in the ether where you can be deep into power electronics one minute and laughing about some wild music idea the next. I’m always working on something: a circuit, a piece of code, a melody, a random experiment that probably started as a joke but somehow turned into a real project. And I think that’s the fun part of all this.
I’m not just building things, I’m building myself as I go.

At the end of the day, I want my life and my work to feel approachable. Whether you’re an engineer, a musician, a gamer, a student, or just someone browsing by, I want this space to feel like you can pull up a chair, jump into whatever I’m working on, and maybe get inspired to start something of your own.

### By the time you reach the end of this page, I hope you think,
“Alright… this guy’s actually pretty cool, and he’s doing some interesting stuff.”
Because that’s really what I’m aiming for: to share the things I build, the things I learn, and the things I love in a way that makes you want to stick around and see what comes next.

I’m always working on new projects. Some serious, some chaotic, some accidentally brilliant. If you’re into engineering, music, creativity, or just people who think a little differently, I think you’ll enjoy following along.
I don’t want to impress you with perfection.
I want to impress you with realness, curiosity, and the energy I bring into everything I do.

So yeah — that’s me. A mix of engineering, curiosity, music, randomness, and a whole lot of genuine good energy. I’m always learning, always building, always trying to make something a little better than it was yesterday. And if all of that makes you want to follow along or see what I make next, you’re in the right place.

### Stick around. Things might get a little wacky!
